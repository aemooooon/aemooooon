# Asking a question

## Clarification on a concept

> Excuse me, Professor Smith, Could you please explain the concept of limits again? I am having trouble understanding how they work.

Sure, I'd be happy to help. Let me give you an example to illustrate the concept. Let's say we have a function f(x) = x^2. The limit of f(x) as x approaches 2 is 4. This means that as x gets closer and closer to 2, the value of f(x) gets closer and closer to 4. Does that help?

Yes, that makes sense. Thank you.

## Problem-solving Assistance

> Hi, professor Johnson, I am stuck on question number 3 in the homework. Could you walk me through how to solve it step by step?

Of course. Let me take a look at the question. Okay, so the question is asking you to find the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 1. To find the derivative, you need to use the power rule. The power rule states that if you have a function f(x) = x^n, then the derivative of f(x) is n*x^(n-1). So, in this case, the derivative of 3x^2 is 6x, the derivative of 2x is 2, and the derivative of -1 is 0. So, the derivative of f(x) is 6x + 2. Does that make sense?

Yes, that helps a lot. Thank you for your help.

## Understanding a theorem

> Professor Lee, I was wondering if you could provide some insights into the proof of the Pythagorean theorem. I am having difficulty grasping the logic behind it.

Sure, I'd be happy to help. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Let's take a look at a right-angled triangle with sides a, b, and c. According to the theorem, a^2 + b^2 = c^2. To prove this, we can use the concept of similar triangles and the area of squares. Let me draw a diagram to illustrate the proof. Does that help?

Yes, that makes sense. Thank you for your help.
