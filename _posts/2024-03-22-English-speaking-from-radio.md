Would you spend your own hard earned cash to get to Miami to see the game?

Unbelievably expensive tickets. Both sets of tickets that were released have been
sold out and people are buying these tickets but we don't know the location on the
lineup yet.

I believe that's why he's doing this because he's trying to get people to buy.

I think the cheapest is sitting around 1500 bucks.

No, I think that's gone up. For the cheapestonly needs to sell 26 VIP tickets to break even. Right?

I imagine he's probably going to throw a few more.

But would you go, are you excited about the prospect?

Did you watch the fire festival documentary? And has that put you off?

Hi, Xiao, So would you go, would you go along to a festival?
