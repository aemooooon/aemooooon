## Hua WANG

Kia ora, my name is Hua, and I come from Enshi, a gathering place of the Tujia ethnic minority in central China. I am a father, a student, and a full-stack developer.

The reason I chose the University of Canterbury is because the Open Day happened five years ago, and I had a chance to attend on-site in the Central Lecture Theatre. The presentations by the science and mathematics lecturers deeply inspired me and impressed me, especially in the field of statistical disciplines.

The reasons for the selection of Applied Data Science are probably due to several factors, such as my academic background, interests, and personal insights. First of all, I graduated from Otago Polytechnic with a bachelor's degree in information technology, which equipped me with a solid foundation and experience in data structure and information organisation. Additionally, my previous work in web development provided me with some experience in data visualisation, particularly through daily data updates following the COVID-19 pandemic, which further hooked my interest in data visualisation.

As a computer science professional, I have been working in the field for many years. Faced with constantly evolving technique stacks and need to invest a lot of time in learning and adapting to new technologies. Personally, I believe that only by integrating the technical skills and tools of computer science with the business logic of a particular domain can we ignite new sparks and suit more to my remaining life. Furthermore, because of the decades of booming internet, major companies and organisations have formed big data; the hardware and algorithms are equipped to handle intensive computational tasks, which opens up more opportunities for technicians like me.

Therefore, I am here. My journey to the University of Canterbury is driven by a desire to combine my expertise in computer science with the emerging area of data science, to explore new possibilities, and to make meaningful contributions in bridging the gap between technology and business. I am excited about the challenges and opportunities ahead. I will remain humble and optimistic and work with my teachers and classmates to help each other learn. Finally, I look forward to immersing myself in the vibrant community at the University of Canterbury.
